# ExplorerOpenTerminal

This is a simple Windows program that allows you to open a Windows Terminal in the directory currently open in the focused Explorer window.

e.g. Ctrl+Alt+A

5. Have an explorer open where you wish to open a terminal
6. Press your shortcut key!

Alternatively, the program can be invoked by pinning it to the task bar and invoking via Win+{{Index on the task bar}} e.g. Win+1

## Notes
* The release binary only supports x64. You can compile for x86 if desired by updating `<PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>` in `ExplorerOpenTerminal.csproj` to x86 and running `publish.bat` ðŸ™‚
* The .NET 9 runtime is required to be installed, as the binary is published as `--self-contained false`
* Sometimes there is ~3 seconds of lag when invoking via the shortcut key. This issue is described in this [Microsoft Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120502-00/?p=7723), and discussed [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1189992/desktop-shortcut-key-takes-too-much-time-to-open) and [here](https://superuser.com/questions/426947/slow-windows-desktop-keyboard-shortcuts). The culprit for me is the `Settings` app, in a `suspended` state, as seen in the Task Manager. Killing the process removes the 3 second delay, but its not an ideal solution. The alternative invocation via Win+1 avoids this issue entirely.
