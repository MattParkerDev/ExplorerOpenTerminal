## Notes
* The release binary only supports x64. You can compile for x86 if desired by updating `<PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>` in `ExplorerOpenTerminal.csproj` to x86 and running `publish.bat` ðŸ™‚
* The .NET 9 runtime is required to be installed, as the binary is published as `--self-contained false`
